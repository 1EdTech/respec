## API

This starts the main body of the spec. This link to [introduction](#intro) uses the custom id <code>#intro</code>.

This part of the spec was included using `data-include` rather than `transclude`. That means it is not interpreted as javascript before it is converted to HTML. Which means you can use triple-backticks to create code-blocks (`<pre>` elements):

```
console.log("hey!");
```

<pre class="example" title="Use triple-backticks to create <pre> elements">

```
console.log("hey!");
```

</pre>
