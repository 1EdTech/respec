<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The EPUB State and Results Specification provides a structured approach for supporting
the passing of state and result data between an EPUB and a Reading System.
This standard based approach enabled EPUB content authors to create interactive
assessments and activities that can both save state and report results back to
compliant reading systems.</p>
