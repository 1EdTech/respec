## Using Markdown

If all of your content is markdown (like this document), add `format: "markdown"`
to your respecConfig. All of the content in the `<body></body>` of the document
will be treated as markdown. And that means all block level HTML elements in the
body must be flush left, not indented.

There are ways to include markdown files into your document: 1) using the 1EdTech transclude plugin,
and 2) using the Respec include plugin. The 1EdTech transclude plugin works
when using a browser to open a Respec file on your local machine and when browsing
a Respec file on a web server (can be a local web server). The
Respec include plugin only works when browing a Respec file on a web server.

Look at the source of this file for an example of both
<pre>
&lt;script class="transclude" data-id="mdbody" src="ims-markdown-part1.md">&lt;/script>
&lt;div data-include="ims-markdown-part2.md" data-include-replace="true">&lt;/div>
</pre>

See [Using Markdown Fragments](#fragments) for advice on how to mix HTML and markdown content.

<script class="transclude" data-id="mdbody" src="markdown-part1.md"></script>
<div data-include="markdown-part2.md" data-include-replace="true"></div>

## Using Markdown Fragments {#fragments}

If you omit `format: "markdown"` from respecConfig Respec will treat the document as HTML.
However, you can mix in markdown fragments by telling Respec to treat the fragments as markdown.
For example,

<pre>
&lt;section data-format="markdown">
## Header A

Some markdown text.
&lt;/section>
</pre>

You can also include markdown files using the 1EdTech transclude and Respec include plugins. Note that
the Respec include plugin must be told the included content is markdown using the `data-format-include="markdown"`
attribute.

<pre>
&lt;section data-format="markdown">
  &lt;script class="transclude" data-id="mdbody" src="ims-markdown-part1.md">&lt;/script>
&lt;/section>
&lt;div data-include="ims-markdown-part2.md" data-include-format="markdown" data-include-replace="true">&lt;/div>
</pre>

</body>
